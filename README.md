# Vue3 Demo: Roll the dice


## My first Vue3 component

I like to work with Vuejs, and today I tried to use the next version of Vuejs: Vue3.

My first question was: how can I create a new Web Application with Vue3 and the right npm dependencies?

To do that, I used Vite as build tool. Vite is an amazing web dev build tool that serves your code via native ES Module imports during dev and bundles it with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for production. Vite uses Vue3. So if we use Vite we have an amazing fast build tool and we have all vue3 dependencies ready to use.
